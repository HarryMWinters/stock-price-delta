# stock-price-delta

When an unnamed finiancial institution took 3 months to transfer some significant funds I began to wonder how much market growth (or loss) I was missing out on.

This app should allow one to specify stock and fund symbols, initial holding value, inital holding date and ending date. It should then numerically and graphically display the change in the value of the specified holdings. Dividends paid should also be shown if publically accesable knowledge.

I'm also using this as an oppertunity ot try out Vue.js.
